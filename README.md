# Manual Setup

Congratulations on finishing the pre-work course and welcome to the program!

To make sure you're fully set up for this phase, we want to ensure all students
have set up their local environments successfully.

Now, we are going to stop utilizing the LEARN IDE! For this we have specific
[instructions][]
to get your local environment set up and ready.

> **Note on STEP 0:**
>
> - _If you have been using the Learn IDE that is built into your browser when
>   you visit learn.co: IGNORE STEP 0, it does not apply._
> - _If you have a DOWNLOADED version of the Learn IDE that opens up in Atom,
>   follow the instructions in STEP 0_

If you went through this process during pre-work and believe your local
environment is already setup, you can verify by running the following script:

```sh
curl -so- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/flatiron-manual-setup-validator/master/manual-setup-check.sh | bash 2> /dev/null
```

If all checks pass, you have completed the setup process and are ready for Phase 1!

After you have followed the instructions linked above for setting up your local
environment, there are additional, [optional installation instructions here][]
to check out.
